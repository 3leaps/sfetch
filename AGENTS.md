## Development Standards

As a security-focused CLI, prioritize transparency and testability:

### Code
- Idiomatic Go: Follow [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) and [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
- No `fmt.Print*` pollution in verification logic; use `fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, ...)` for errors.
- Error wrapping: `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`.

### Testing
- Unit: Table-driven tests covering edge cases (e.g., invalid sigs, checksum mismatches).
- Integration: `go test ./...` + `testdata/` fixtures; verify full flows.
- Run: `make test` (or `go test ./... -v`).

### Verification
- Linting: `go fmt ./... && go vet ./...`.
- Security changes: Add tests for verification paths; run integration tests.
- Skepticism: All sig/checksum logic must be auditable; prefer stdlib crypto.

Keep docs minimal; focus on tests for assurance.
