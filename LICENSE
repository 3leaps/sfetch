  and CI pipelines

What we ask you not to do:

- Create a separate product, service, or distribution called "sfetch" or using
  "sfetch" as a prominent name element (e.g., "sfetch-pro", "YourCo sfetch",
  "sfetch-enterprise")
- Use "sfetch" in a way that suggests official affiliation with or endorsement
  by 3 Leaps, LLC
