sfetch quickstart
=================

Install a signed release from GitHub in three steps:

1. Choose the release selector:
   - `-latest` for the newest tag
   - `-tag v0.2.0` to pin a specific version

2. Select the asset (optional override):
   - `-asset-match "install-sfetch.sh"` (glob/substring)
   - `-asset-regex "tool-.*-darwin-amd64.tar.gz$"` (advanced)

3. Provide the verification material:
   - PGP signatures (`*.asc`): `-pgp-key-file fulmen-release.asc`
   - Raw ed25519 signatures (`*.sig`): `-key <64-hex-bytes>`

4. Choose install destination:
   - `-output /usr/local/bin/tool` to clobber a path
   - `-dest-dir ./bin` to place the extracted binary there

Examples:
  sfetch -repo fulmenhq/goneat -latest -dest-dir ./bin -pgp-key-file fulmen-release.asc
  sfetch -repo 3leaps/sfetch -latest -asset-match "install-sfetch.sh" -dest-dir /tmp

PGP key lookup order:
 1. `-pgp-key-file /path/to/key.asc` (if it starts with http/https, the file is downloaded first)
 2. `-pgp-key-url https://example.com/key.asc`
 3. `-pgp-key-asset fulmen-release.asc` (download companion asset from release)
 4. Auto-detect `.asc` assets containing "key"/"release" if none of the above were set

Build/install helpers:
  make build
  make install                 # installs to ~/.local/bin (or %USERPROFILE%\bin on Windows)
  INSTALL_BINDIR=~/bin make install   # override install dir without editing files
  # Edit buildconfig.mk once to change NAME or the default INSTALL_BINDIR for everyone

Environment knobs:
  SFETCH_API_BASE  Override the GitHub API base (use enterprise hubs)
  XDG_CACHE_HOME   Override the cache root (default ~/.cache/sfetch)

Safety defaults:
- Checksums must match SHA256/512 per repo config
- Signatures are mandatory unless `-skip-sig` (testing only)
- PGP keys import into a temporary GNUPGHOME and are deleted after verification
