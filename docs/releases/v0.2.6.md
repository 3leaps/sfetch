# v0.2.6

## Summary
Improved reliability in containerized CI by handling cross-device installs/caching automatically, plus internal refactoring to improve auditability (no intended CLI behavior changes).

## Highlights

### Cross-device install/caching fix (EXDEV)
- When `--dest-dir` or `--cache-dir` is on a different filesystem than the temp directory (common with container mounts), sfetch now falls back to a copy operation when `rename(2)` fails with “invalid cross-device link”.

### CI/CD documentation
- New guide: `docs/cicd-usage-guide.md` (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, container runners).

### CI container probe
- CI now includes a containerized install probe that installs sfetch via `install-sfetch.sh` and uses it to install a verified tool, to catch EXDEV regressions early.
