## Summary
Windows .zip extraction fix and release DX alignment with fulseed conventions.

## Highlights

### Windows .zip extraction fix
- Fixed archive format classification where the legacy `archiveType: "tar.gz"` default overrode the correctly-inferred `.zip` format from the file extension. This caused Windows `.zip` assets (e.g., `goneat_v0.5.3_windows_amd64.zip`) to be extracted with `tar` instead of Go's `archive/zip`, producing `exit status 2` errors.
- Root cause: the legacy compatibility guard in `classifyAsset` applied the config's `archiveType` even when `inferArchiveFormat` had already correctly determined the format from the extension.

### Release DX alignment
- Renamed `SHA2-512SUMS` to `SHA512SUMS` in release tooling (goreleaser/fulseed convention)
- Added unified Makefile targets: `release-export-keys`, `release-verify-keys`, `release-verify-signatures`
- Added `release-upload-provenance` target (manifests, signatures, keys only)
- Renamed `verify-release-key` → `release-verify-key` (consistent `release-` prefix)
- Renamed `sign-release-assets.sh` → `sign-release-manifests.sh`
- Fixed upload script to handle missing signature files gracefully
- Added `scripts/verify-signatures.sh` for post-sign verification
- Bumped goneat to v0.5.3 across CI and Makefile

## Breaking Changes
- `SHA2-512SUMS` manifest renamed to `SHA512SUMS` in release artifacts. sfetch still recognizes `SHA2-512SUMS` from other projects.
- Makefile targets `verify-release-key` and `verify-minisign-pubkey` renamed to `release-verify-key` and `release-verify-minisign-pubkey`.

## Migration
No migration required for users. Maintainers using the release signing workflow should update their scripts to use the new target names.

## Validation
- `go test ./...` passes locally.
- `make precommit` passes locally (tests, lint, schema validation, gosec, cross-platform build).

## Examples

Install goneat on Windows via sfetch:
```bash
sfetch --repo fulmenhq/goneat --tag v0.5.3 --dest-dir .\bin --require-minisign
```

Update sfetch:
```bash
sfetch --self-update --yes
```
