## Summary
Remove the external `unzip` dependency by extracting ZIP archives with the Go standard library, improving portability in minimal containers and CI runners.

## Highlights

### Pure-Go ZIP extraction
- `.zip` assets are extracted with `archive/zip` (no `unzip` required).
- Extraction rejects ZIP slip/path traversal, absolute paths, and symlinks.
