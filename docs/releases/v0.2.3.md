# v0.2.3

## Summary
Installer hardening and signing script improvements for custom GPG environments.

## Highlights

- **Installer parsing improvements**
  - Prefer `jq` (if present) for GitHub release JSON parsing; dependency-free fallback retained.
  - Added threat-model comments for pre-extraction path traversal scanning and unzip listing portability.
  - `make bootstrap` now advisory via `prereqs-advise`; `make prereqs` remains strict.

- **Signing script fixes**
  - Added `GPG_HOMEDIR` environment variable support for custom GPG homedirs.
  - Uses `env GNUPGHOME=...` to avoid polluting user's global GPG settings.
  - Updated `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` to document all required environment variables.

- **Documentation updates**
  - Updated docs to reflect checksum-only opt-in and signature defaults.
  - Added DO/DONOT section to `AGENTS.md` with push approval and release merge policies.
