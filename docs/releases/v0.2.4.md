# v0.2.4

## Summary
Bug fix for self-update failing when SHA2-512SUMS is preferred over SHA256SUMS.

## Highlights

- **Fixed self-update checksum mismatch**
  - Self-update and fetch now correctly detect the hash algorithm from the checksum filename.
  - Previously, when SHA2-512SUMS was selected (preferred over SHA256SUMS), the code still used sha256 for hashing, causing "checksum not found" errors.

## Details
- Added `detectChecksumAlgorithm()` to infer sha256/sha512 from checksum file naming patterns.
- Assessment now sets `ChecksumAlgorithm` based on actual checksum file, not config default.
