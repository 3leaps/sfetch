## Summary

Fix asset selection for tools with "sig" in their name (minisign, cosign, etc.) and document install permission behavior.

## Highlights

### Asset selection fix for minisign and similar tools

The `looksLikeSupplemental()` function previously used a broad substring check for "sig" to detect signature files. This caused false positives for tools containing "sig" in their name:

- `minisign` - the minisign signing tool
- `cosign` - container signing tool  
- `design-tool` - any tool with "design" in the name

These assets were incorrectly filtered out before platform matching could run, resulting in "no asset matches GOOS/GOARCH heuristics" errors.

**Before:**
```bash
$ sfetch --repo jedisct1/minisign --latest --dry-run
no asset matches GOOS/GOARCH heuristics
```

**After:**
```bash
$ sfetch --repo jedisct1/minisign --latest --dry-run
Asset: minisign-0.12-macos.zip (81.5 KB)
Workflow: B (per-asset signature)
Trust: medium
```

### Install permissions documentation

Added documentation to README explaining permission behavior:
- Archives preserve permissions from archive contents
- Raw scripts/binaries are set to `0755` on macOS/Linux
- Cross-device installs preserve source permissions via copy fallback
