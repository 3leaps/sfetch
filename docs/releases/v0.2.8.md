## Summary
Tighten installation ergonomics and verification-related test coverage: warn on Linux `noexec` destinations, improve deterministic install-path testing, and add low-risk unit tests for internal helpers.

## Highlights

### Linux `noexec` destination warning (best effort)
- When the install destination appears to be mounted with `noexec`, sfetch prints a warning explaining that `chmod +x` won’t fix it.

### Install-path test coverage (rename vs copy fallback)
- Added unit tests that cover executable permission behavior for raw and archive installs across both rename and EXDEV copy fallback paths.
- Added a Windows-only test covering the self-update locked-target `.new` fallback.

### Internal helper coverage (low risk)
- Added unit tests for `internal/verify` checksum parsing and key normalization.
- Added unit tests for `internal/selfupdate` target path selection.
