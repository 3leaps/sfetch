## Summary
Introduce a numeric trust rating system (0–100) with transparent factor breakdown and optional policy gating via `--trust-minimum`.

## Highlights

### Trust rating (v0.3.0)
- Trust is now reported as `N/100 (level)` with factor breakdown (signature/checksum/transport/algo).
- New workflow `none` distinguishes “source provides no verification artifacts” from explicit bypass (`--insecure`).
- Provenance JSON includes a new `trust` object and retains legacy `trustLevel` for one minor cycle.

### Policy gating
- `--trust-minimum <0-100>` blocks downloads below the specified threshold and prints factor breakdown on failure.

### Dogfood corpus (opt-in)
- Dogfood set lives in `testdata/corpus.json` and is runnable via `make corpus-dryrun`.
- Corpus now includes “known ecosystem patterns” (e.g., curl|sh installers) as expected-fail entries to track future support for raw GitHub content and arbitrary URLs.
