## Summary
Fix raw script handling so `install-sfetch.sh` and similar assets work correctly.

## Highlights

### Raw script fix
- **Raw scripts no longer misclassified as archives:** Fixed regression where scripts like `install-sfetch.sh` failed with "extract archive: exit status 1" when fetched alongside archive assets.
- The legacy `archiveType` config field now only applies to assets that are actually archives or have unknown type, preserving correct classification of raw scripts and packages.

### Release process
- Added `make release-verify-checksums` step to `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` to validate checksums before upload.
